This is my solution to an assignment that I found online.

The assignment name was "Tropical Island."

You are in a rectangular island. Its width is M, length is N. Its landscape can
be written as an integer matrix, where an integer denotes the height in a given point.
For instance, this is a small 3x3 island:

4 5 4
3 1 5
5 4 1

When it rains the island gets full of water, and all its lowlands become lakes.
Let us define a lowland as a part of the island whose cells are positioned 
next to higher (greater value) cells. Diagonals are ignored. Sea level shall be 0.
In the example above, there is only one lowland place: the center cell with
the value of 1 (next to it, there are cells with values of 3, 5, 5, and 4.)

Therefore after a rain the height of these cells will change as follows:

4 5 4
3 3 5
5 4 1

We can see that the lowland has grown from 1 to 3, after which the water 
started flowing to the cells sitting next to it, and eventually into the sea.
The full volume of the water which got trapped in the lowlands is 2 cubic cells.
Here is a more complicated example:

5 3 4 5
6 2 1 4
3 1 1 4
8 5 4 3

After a rain, it changes this way:

5 3 4 5
6 3 3 4
3 3 3 4
8 5 4 3

The full volume of water which stays in the island after a rain is 7 cubic cells!
Your program should take a two-dimensional array and return an int which denotes
the total volume of water staying in the island after a rain.

Details:
The island dimensions / width and length, M and N, are integers [1, 50]
The heights are integers [1, 1000].
Here are some more examples of input data:

4 5 4
3 1 5
5 4 1

5 3 4 5
6 2 1 4
3 1 1 4
8 5 4 3

2 2 2
2 1 2
2 1 2
2 1 2

Your program should return the following respectively:

2
7
0
